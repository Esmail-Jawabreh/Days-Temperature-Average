## Days-Temperature-Average

#### This is a simple project aimed at practicing working with lists. 
#### The project calculates the average temperature for a given number of days and determines the number of days that have temperatures above the average.
<br>

#### How it works:
- The program prompts the user to enter the number of days for which they want to record temperatures.
- Next, the user is asked to input the high temperature for each day.
- The program calculates the average temperature by summing up all the temperatures and dividing by the total number of days.
- It then counts the number of days that have temperatures above the average and stores their day numbers.
- Finally, the program displays the average temperature, the number of days above average, and the day numbers that have temperatures above average.

#### Example Usage:
```
How many day's temperature? 5
Day 1's high temperature: 20
Day 2's high temperature: 22
Day 3's high temperature: 25
Day 4's high temperature: 18
Day 5's high temperature: 23

Average temperature = 21.6
3 day(s) above average.
Days above average: 2, 3, 5
```

#### This project serves as a simple exercise to practice working with lists and performing calculations based on the input data.
